# SHREC2024 - Hand Motion Recognition  

## Description

This repository contains the submission, i.e. the code and models, by
* Martin Hanik,
* Esfandiar Navayazdani, and
* Christoph von Tycowicz

to the [Recognition Of Hand Motions Molding Clay](https://www.shrec.net/SHREC-2024-hand-motion/) track of the 3D Shape Retrieval Challenge (SHREC) 2024.
The task is to classify highly similar hand motion sequences from a professional potter into one out of seven classes.
The sequences are of variable length and comprise 3D coordinate data of landmarks on both potters hands.
